# Password Generator

To reinforce what I have learned in bootcamp so far I wanted to create a password generator. 
This password generator will be excellent to create secure passwords that cannot be easily decifered. 

I learned how to go about piecing all the variables and pieces of JavaScript together that I have learned so far. 
For Loops, variables, if statements, methods...were obviously very important and are a foundation of what is to come.
